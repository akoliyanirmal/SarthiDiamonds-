            Did you know that almost 80% of all rough diamonds pass through
            different hands in the city of Antwerp, Belgium? Out of these rough
            stones that are traded, 92% of them will end up in India and are
            actually cut in the city of Surat.<br /><br />
            This means whatever diamond you are buying in the market today has

            How Are Diamonds Cut And Polished From Roughs?
          </p>
          <p class="process_desc">
            Diamond cutting is the process that takes a rough diamond and
            changes it into a shaped and beautiful gem. The process must be
            undertaken by a professional with expert knowledge, equipment and
            tools for the job since every single decision made will affect the
            outcome of profitability.<br /><br />
            So, what are the main considerations a cutter take into account when
            planning to cut a diamond? The first choice to make is to decide on
            the shape itself round, oval, pear etc. And secondly, the
            proportioning of facets and quality of the cut (i.e. symmetry and
            polish) are planned with computer simulations. In this process, I'll
            be showing you what really goes on behind the scenes when a plain
            looking rough gets transformed into a bright, shiny gem.

            The Diamond Cutting And Polishing Process
          </p>
          <p class="process_desc">
            Since diamonds are made of the hardest material in the world, only a
            diamond can be used to mechanically cut another diamond. Lasers are
            another alternative but their uses are largely limited to the
            cleaving and bruting purposes. Usually, the tools used in the
            workshop consist of diamond-bladed edges or discs that are lined in
            diamond dust.
          </p>
          <p class="process_desc">
            The actual process of how diamonds are cut and polished can be
            broken down into five steps:<b>
              planning, cleaving, bruting, polishing and inspecting.</b

          <p class="process_desc">
            Planning to cut a rough stone is one of the most important things to
            get right. While it can be a time consuming process, this is also
            the step that determines the final value of the finished products.
          </p>
          <p class="process_desc">
            In the planning stages, the cutter will figure out the best possible
            shapes of the diamond in order to minimize waste and maximize the
            yield of the rough stone. Typically, the rough stone is mapped with
            a Sarin machine to generate accurate measurements. With this data, a
            computer software is then used to formulate 3D models that will show
            the cutter the best ways to optimize the rough.

            The cleaving process is the part that involves splitting the rough
            into separate pieces. This will then allow the cutter to work on the
            pieces separately and also to utilize the rough fully. Mechanical
            sawing can also be undertaken at this stage. In the case of oddly
            shaped roughs, the sawing process can also be undertaken with
            contactless cutting tools like lasers.

          <p class="process_desc">
            After the diamond is split, bruting is then performed to make the
            separated rough stones round. This is process is also known as
            girdling. What happens here is that two diamonds are placed on a
            spinning axle across each other. They will then turn in opposite
            directions and grind against each other to create a rough girdle
            finish.

          <p class="process_desc">
            Once the rounded shape of the rough is formed, the next stage is to
            create and form the facets of the diamond. The cutter places the
            rough on a rotating arm and uses a spinning wheel to polish the
            rough. This creates the smooth and reflective facets on the diamond.
          </p>
          <p class="process_desc">
            Interestingly, this polishing procedure is further divided into 2
            steps: blocking and brillianteering. In the blocking process, 8
            pavilion mains, 8 crowns, 1 culet and 1 table facet are added to
            make a single cut stone. The importance of this step is to create a
            template for the next stage.
            The brillianteer will then finish up the job by adding in the
            remaining facets and bringing it to a total of 57 facets. He holds
            great responsibility as the fire and brilliance of the diamond is
            determined at this stage.
